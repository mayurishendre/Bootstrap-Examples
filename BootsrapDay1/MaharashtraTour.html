    <p>
        Mayanagri, the city of dreams, the one that never sleeps, India’s financial centre, Bollywood—Mumbai has many names and it lives up to each of them every day. Dotted with well-maintained architectural wonders from India’s colonial past, Mumbai offers a visual treat to Gothic architecture lovers. Meanwhile, for those who wish to experience the charm of a fast-moving city, a quick hop on the Mumbai local during the peak hours will be a story to tell.
        Or just embark on a 15-minute ferry ride from Gateway of India jetty to revisit a lost world at Elephanta Island.

    <p>
        Cultural capital of Maharashtra, Pune holds a place of pride in every Marathi’s heart. Once a political centre of the Indian sub-continent, Pune was the seat of Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. The district alone boasts of 17 forts of which the most famous are Shaniwar Wada, Singhagad Fort and Purandar Fort, closely followed by a remarkably different looking Aga Khan Palace that served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi soon after he launched the Quit India movement.
        Pune is a heaven for an art, culture and adventure lover.

    <p>Nestled amid the scenic Western Ghats, this popular hill station is known for its breath-taking landscapes, evergreen timberlands, waterfalls and ancient temples. A trip to Mahabaleshwar means boating in Venna Lake, undertaking a sunset trek to the Pratapgarh Fort, visiting Rajpuri Caves, tantalising your taste buds with freshly-plucked berries and clicking picture-perfect photos with astounding views of the hills and valleys in the background.</p>
