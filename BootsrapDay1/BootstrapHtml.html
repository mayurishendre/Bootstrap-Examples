        <h3> Information Of Home Architecture  Design</h3>


        <p>
            Whether you’re looking for your first home or a new investment property,
            you’ve probably noticed a lot of terminology surrounding house styles and their structures.
            Understanding this terminology can help you find the home you’re looking for,
            foresee common issues for your home inspection and learn the benefits associated with certain home types.<br />

            It’s important to note the two main parameters that classify a home: the structure type and the style of the home.
            The structure refers to the type of building, like a single-family home or a condo.
            The style refers to the architectural features and design, like Craftsman or contemporary

                    <p>
                        An apartment is part of a collection of similar units in one building structure.
                        An important feature is that you have to rent the place from a landlord. Oftentimes, apartments and apartment buildings 
                        have convenience factors like an on-site repair worker, laundry, gym facilities or a pool.
                        Though you don’t get as much privacy – and you won’t be building equity in your residence – you’ll have many additional pros and cons to weigh when deciding whether to buy or rent.<br />

                        <h4> 2. Single-Family</h4>
                     <p>
                           The key feature of a single-family home is that it’s completely detached from other housing units, unlike condos, apartments or townhomes. The majority of homes in the U.S. are single-family homes.
                           They’re less common in highly populated areas and are typically found in suburbs. Single-family homes are usually more private and offer more options for personalization (barring any homeowners association (HOA) requirements).<br />

                                   <li> Pros: Single-family homes have greater privacy and more freedom than most other homes.</li>
                                    <li>  Cons: They typically cost more to maintain and own</li>

                    <p>
                        If you like the conveniences that come with an apartment but are looking to own, a condo might be a great fit for you. 
                        Instead of having a building manager or landlord oversee your unit, you’re in charge of all the repairs and the upkeep.

                            Condominiums are a great option for city living and for older adults who want to own and have a mortgage but don’t want to deal with the upkeep of a single-family home.
                            <li>Pros: There’s less upkeep than a single-family home, along with the benefits of homeownership.</li>
                            <li> Cons: There’s less privacy and free agency.</li>
